# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This Breast Cancer Classification project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer using histopathological images. It includes a Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The repository serves as a practical implementation of classification algorithms to aid in the early detection of breast cancer, which is critical for patient outcomes.
